### How are counties grouped in Maryland based on different health metrics?

__Anchor 1__ is a cluster of _slightly greater_ overall mortaltity rate, _slightly less than one standard deviation greater_ diabetes mortality rate, _slightly less than average_ diabetes prevalence rate, and _less than average_ obesity prevalence rate.

__Anchor 2__ is a cluster of _one standard deviation greater_ overall mortality rate, _slight more than one standard deviation less than average_ diabetes mortality rate, _slightly less than one standard deviation greater_ diabetes prevalence rate, and _slightly less than one standard deviation greater_ obesity prevalence rate.

__Anchor 3__ is a cluster of _one and a half standard deviations less than average_ overall mortality rate, _slightly more than one standard deviation less than average_ diabetes mortalityr rate,  _slightly less than  one standard deviation less than average_ diabetes prevalence rate, and _less than average_ obesity prevalence rate.

In general, the overall health ranking is:

    1. Anchor 3
    2. Anchor 1
    3. Anchor 2

Here, we see that the sum of the mininum distance squared is 48.138. For 24 counties, the average comes out to be about 2 units of mininum distance squared per county. This is not the strongest correlation of each county in their corresponding anchor groups, but it is a fair number to assume that these counties are grouped fairly.

Here, the counties are distributed more heavily in anchor 1 and even spread out between anchors 2 and 3.

- Anchor 1: 12 counties (Baltimore County)

- Anchor 2: 6 counties (Caroline)

- Anchor 3: 6 counties (Talbot)
